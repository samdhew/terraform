# Terraform AWS Database Modules

Welcome to the Terraform AWS Database Modules Repository! This collection includes a set of composite Terraform modules designed specifically for managing databases on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Whether you're setting up relational databases, NoSQL databases, or caching solutions, these composite modules can serve as essential tools for configuring and managing your database infrastructure.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide a collection of composite Terraform modules tailored for AWS databases. Each module encapsulates best practices, configurations, and reusable patterns for different database services available on AWS. From Amazon RDS to DynamoDB, these modules aim to streamline and simplify the process of provisioning and configuring databases.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine before using these modules. You can download the latest version of Terraform from the official [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### Module Structure
- Each module is contained in its own directory, organized by the type of database service.
- Modules may include example configurations, variable definitions, and outputs to guide usage.

### How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired composite database module.
3. Integrate the module into your Terraform configuration using the `module` block.

```hcl
module "example_database_module" {
  source = "./path/to/example_database_module"
  
  # Customize module variables
  variable_name = "value"
  
  # Additional configuration as needed
}
```
